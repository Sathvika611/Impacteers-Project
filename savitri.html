<h3>Early life</h3>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:Tw Cen MT">Nissankara Savitri was born on 6 December 1935 in a Telugu-speaking family in Chirravuru, Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh. Her father was Nissankara Guruvaiya and her mother was Nissankara Subhadramma.Her father died when she was six months old, after which her mother took Savitri and an older sibling, Maruti, to live with an aunt and uncle. Her uncle, Kommareddy Venkataramaiah Chowdary, enrolled her in classes when she began to show a talent for dance.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tw Cen MT">She was named for the expression of her eyes during dramas. She participated in many dramas, in one of which she was rewarded with a garland by the famous actor Prithvi Raj Kapoor. She, along with her grandfather, went to the Vijaya Vahini studio in Chennai to enroll Savitri as a character in a movie, though they refused to do so. Not giving up, they tried once again, in another cinema, where she managed to get a role, but could not stand it as she hesitated in reciting dialogues because she was in awe when talking to the hero.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tw Cen MT">It was then that she met Ramaswamy Ganesan, also known as Gemini Ganesan, who took pics of Savitri and instructed the duo that they come after two months. Defeated, Savitri went back to her village and continued playing dramas. On one specific day a man came to their home and asked Savitri to play a role for his cinema. Savitri's career thus began. Savitri married Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan in 1952, having first met him in 1948. The marriage led to a permanent rift with her uncle because Ganesan was already married, had four daughters, and was involved in an affair with Pushpavalli. Her marriage became public when she signed a photograph as Savitri Ganesh.Ganesan later acknowledged that he had two daughters with Pushpavalli while married to Savitri, with whom he had a daughter and a son.</p>
